# VersionOne: The Future of Building on Sonic

## Current Development Challenges

In the world of traditional  development, builders often face a harsh reality. They come up with a brilliant idea, pour countless hours and financial resources into coding, only to launch and hear‚Ä¶ crickets. Months of effort and significant funding are wasted on unproven concepts that fail to capture user interest.

Take, for example, the \$30M startup that spent two years building a product, only to see it flop due to lack of validation before launch. The startup‚Äôs failure was a stark reminder of how common this problem is across the blockchain industry. (Sources: [link 1](#), [link 2](#))

## Introducing VersionOne&#x20;

Instead of building in the dark,  builders quickly build v1 and validate their ideas with the help of AI agents. It's as simply as builders describing their idea, and the platform‚Äôs agents swing into action, building a working v1 in no time.

The v1 is then listed on Pad19 (our idea launchpad), where users can interact with it, provide feedback, and rate it ‚≠êÔ∏è. Based on  user interactions with v1 The builders can choose to continue development and build out the full idea.

## No One Left Behind: Non-Technical Builders Matter

VersionOne isn‚Äôt just for coders. Non-technical users can also bring their ideas to life by chatting away with the agents that quickly launch v1 When their idea finds traction amongst users (certain usage  quota) the Sonic Dev. team is flagged and they decide whether push ahead with the idea and fully develop it on the Sonic ecosystem.

## Why VersionOne? Everyone Wins üèÖ

***For Builders:*** Build, launch and validate your ideas quickly, commit only to building ideas with sufficient traction. Save development time and money.

***For Non-Technical Users***: Non-technical users can still submit their ideas and, if successfully built, earn a portion of the dApp's revenue throughout its lifecycle.

***For the Sonic Ecosystem:*** Proven, user-approved concepts get developed, improving the overall Sonic ecosystem while rewarding both developers and idea contributors.



### **How It Works**

We have built a multi-agent orchestration environment that handles intent routing between 4 specialized agents who work together seamlessly through recursive chat systems:


1. ***Risha - The Visionary Architect:***

Role: Risha takes the user's idea and breaks it down into an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), ensuring that the concept is practical, scalable, and aligned with user expectations.

Skills: Risha‚Äôs ability to quickly identify the core features needed for a product launch ensures no time is wasted on unnecessary features.


2. ***Pearl - The Designer:***

Role: Once the MVP is defined, Pearl steps in to design the user experience (UX) and interface (UI). She ensures that the product is intuitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly, making sure the idea is not only functional but also accessible to a broad user base.

Skills: Pearl‚Äôs eye for detail guarantees a seamless interface that resonates with the target audience.


***Qwen - The Smart Contract Engineer:***

Role: Qwen takes the MVP and integrates it with the Sonic blockchain. He writes the necessary smart contracts, deploys them, and ensures the app is fully functional on-chain. This agent brings the product to life within the ecosystem.

Skills: With expertise in blockchain and smart contracts, Qwen ensures secure, efficient, and reliable interactions on the Sonic network.


***Mona - The Growth Catalyst:***

Role: Mona focuses on marketing and community building. She crafts engaging social media campaigns, creates content to promote the product, and drives adoption through various promotional efforts.

Skills: Mona‚Äôs deep understanding of community engagement ensures the product gains traction early, while her creative skills generate the buzz needed for success.


The agents collaborate through recursive chat systems to share knowledge and coordinate actions. For example:


User Submits Idea: A non-technical or technical user submits their idea to VersionOne.

MVP Creation: Risha builds a functional MVP based on the submitted concept, which is then handed off to Pearl for design.

Smart Contract Integration: Qwen takes the MVP and deploys the necessary smart contracts on the Sonic blockchain, ensuring all functionality works on-chain.

Marketing and Launch: Mona markets the MVP on Pad19, our idea launchpad, where users can interact with the prototype, provide feedback, and rate it ‚≠êÔ∏è.



The system works autonomously, requiring only high-level instructions from users. When a user sends a message, it's interpreted as an intent and routed to the appropriate agent. The agent can either:

\- Complete the task and respond directly to the user

\- Engage other agents through recursive inference for complex tasks

\- Utilize their specialized tools to execute specific actions



This autonomous coordination delivers faster results while reducing the need for manual intervention, making complex dev. operations accessible through simple natural language interactions.



**Benefits of VersionOne:**

- **Multi-Agent System**: Four agents collaborating to build the perfect V1.
- **Quick Prototyping**: Test your idea in real time with user feedback.
- **Inclusive for Technical and Non-Technical Builders:** Empowering everyone to launch their ideas.
- **Proven Concepts Get Built:** Only the best ideas are taken to the next level.
- **Save Time and Funding**: Focus on ideas that matter, without wasting resources.
